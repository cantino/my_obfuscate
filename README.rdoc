You want to develop against real production data, but you don't want to violate your users' privacy.  Enter MyObfuscate: standalone Ruby code for the selective rewriting of SQL dumps in order to protect user privacy.  It supports MySQL, Postgres, and SQL Server.

= Install

  (sudo) gem install my_obfuscate

= Example Usage

Make an obfuscator.rb script:

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require "rubygems"
  require "my_obfuscate"

  obfuscator = MyObfuscate.new({
    :people => {
      :email                     => { :type => :email, :skip_regexes => [/^[\w\.\_]+@my_company\.com$/i] },
      :ethnicity                 => :keep,
      :crypted_password          => { :type => :fixed, :string => "SOME_FIXED_PASSWORD_FOR_EASE_OF_DEBUGGING" },
      :salt                      => { :type => :fixed, :string => "SOME_THING" },
      :remember_token            => :null,
      :remember_token_expires_at => :null,
      :age                       => { :type => :null, :unless => lambda { |person| person[:email] == "hello@example.com" } },
      :photo_file_name           => :null,
      :photo_content_type        => :null,
      :photo_file_size           => :null,
      :photo_updated_at          => :null,
      :postal_code               => { :type => :fixed, :string => "94109", :unless => lambda {|person| person[:postal_code] == "12345"} },
      :name                      => :name,
      :full_address              => :address,
      :bio                       => { :type => :lorem, :number => 4 },
      :relationship_status       => { :type => :fixed, :one_of => ["Single", "Divorced", "Married", "Engaged", "In a Relationship"] },
      :has_children              => { :type => :integer, :between => 0..1 },
    },

    :invites                     => :truncate,
    :invite_requests             => :truncate,
    :tags                        => :keep,

    :relationships => {
      :account_id                => :keep,
      :code                      => { :type => :string, :length => 8, :chars => MyObfuscate::USERNAME_CHARS }
    }
  })
  obfuscator.fail_on_unspecified_columns = true # if you want it to require every column in the table to be in the above definition
  obfuscator.globally_kept_columns = %w[id created_at updated_at] # if you set fail_on_unspecified_columns, you may want this as well
  obfuscator.obfuscate(STDIN, STDOUT)

And to get an obfuscated dump:

    mysqldump -c --add-drop-table --hex-blob -u user -ppassword database | ruby obfuscator.rb > obfuscated_dump.sql

Note that the -c option on mysqldump is required to use my_obfuscator.  Additionally, the default behavior of mysqldump
is to output special characters. This may cause trouble, so you can request hex-encoded blob content with --hex-blob.
If you get MySQL errors due to very long lines, try some combination of --max_allowed_packet=128M, --single-transaction, --skip-extended-insert, and --quick.

== Database Server

By default the database type is assumed to be MySQL, but you can use the
builtin SQL Server support by specifying:

    obfuscator.database_type = :sql_server
    obfuscator.database_type = :postgres

If using Postgres, use pg_dump to get a dump:

    pg_dump database | ruby obfuscator.rb > obfuscated_dump.sql

== Types

Available types include: email, string, lorem, name, first_name, last_name, address, street_address, city, state,
zip_code, phone, company, ipv4, ipv6, url, integer, fixed, null, and keep.

== Changes

* Support for Postgres.  Thanks @samuelreh!
* Support for SQL Server
* :unless and :if now support :nil as a shorthand for a Proc that checks for nil
* :name, :lorem, and :address are all now supported types.  You can pass :number to :lorem to specify how many sentences to generate.  The default is one.
* <tt>{ :type => :whatever }</tt> is now optional when no additional options are needed.  Just use <tt>:whatever</tt>.
* Warnings are thrown when an unknown column type or table is encountered.  Use <tt>:keep</tt> in both cases.
* <tt>{ :type => :fixed, :string => Proc { |row| ... } }</tt> is now available.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.  (If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Thanks
